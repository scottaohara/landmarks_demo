A demonstration document of the different landmark roles, and some high level information about each.  


## For more information...

A companion blog post to this landmark demo can be found on my website: [Accessible Landmarks](http://www.scottohara.me/blog/2018/03/03/landmarks.html).

The post covers the different landmarks, how to access them with different screen readers, as well as other related information.
