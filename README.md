# Landmarks Demo 
A demonstration document of the different landmark roles, and some high level information about each.  


## For more information...
I've written a compantion article to this landmark demo, [Accessible Landmarks](http://www.scottohara.me/blog/2018/03/03/landmarks.html).

The article covers the different landmarks, how to access them with different screen readers, as well as outlining some misconceptions about what elemenets are considered landmarks and a few known bugs.
